Objective:
To design and implement a radar-based object detection system using Arduino, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, RGB LED, buzzer, and Processing IDE to visualize objects and measure their distance within a defined arc.

Components Used:
•	Arduino UNO board
•	HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
•	Servo Motor (e.g., SG90)
•	RGB LED (Common Cathode)
•	Buzzer
•	Jumper wires and Breadboard
•	Resistors (3 × 220Ω for RGB LED)
•	USB Cable (for Arduino)
•	Personal Computer (for Processing IDE)


Theory:
This project mimics a basic radar system using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor. The sensor rotates from 0° to 180° and back, scanning for nearby objects. The distance and angle data are sent from Arduino via serial communication to the Processing IDE, where it is visualized in a radar-like interface.
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses sound waves to detect objects. It emits ultrasonic pulses and calculates the distance to an object based on the time it takes for the echo to return. A servo motor sweeps the sensor across an angular range, and the Processing software simulates a radar display.
An RGB LED provides color-coded alerts based on distance:
•	Red: Object within 20 cm
•	Green: Object within 30 cm
•	Blue: Object within 40 cm
A buzzer activates when an object is very close (≤10 cm), simulating a proximity alert.

Applications:
•	Home/Office security systems
•	Obstacle detection for robotics
•	Entry monitoring at doors or windows
•	Motion tracking and detection systems
•	Object mapping in small-scale environments

Future Advancements:
•	Replace ultrasonic sensor with LiDAR for higher precision and range
•	Add wireless communication (e.g., Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) for remote monitoring
•	Use camera module and image processing for object identification
•	Integration with IoT platforms for real-time alerts via mobile devices
•	Upgrade to 360° scanning using a continuous rotation servo or stepper motor


Application in Mining:
•	Proximity detection of personnel or equipment in underground tunnels
•	Obstacle sensing in confined mining environments
•	Assist in automation of mine equipment by mapping surroundings
•	Enhance safety systems in shafts or haulage roads
•	Detect cave-ins or movement in high-risk zones using reflective object detection
